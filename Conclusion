Bullet Points for Conclusion (not a comprehensive list / does not touch on methodology etc.)

Unfortunately not able to refute or support our hypothesis based on our visualisations and data analysis. 

we realised various limitations along our analyses, e.g. fatal encounters not only indicator of police brutality and could have looked at longer periods of time, cause and effect might show temporally staggered(?). Also funding does not equal funding ie having data on specific expenditures might be useful. But these limitations could be inspiration for future research?

What we did come across and might be worth looking into further is the relationship between density of Black population compared to encounters. Maybe there are structural issues like marginalisation? 

Could conclude that the non-conclusiveness of our results just highlights once more the fact that raicsm is a complex issue and probably many factors interrelate. Nonetheless this shouldnt stop research but rather encourage large scale studies on the topic. While we cannot support the claims by BLM, neither can we refute them.
