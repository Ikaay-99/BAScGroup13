Census data :
Quick facts is a website providing statistics gathered from various U.S Census Bureau censuses, surveys and programs. By using tables and selecting facts we narrowed down the data for the population type, years and geographic location we wished to explore. This allowed us to break down the racial demographics by state. 

Fatal Encounters is an impartial and searchable database of all deaths through police interaction in the United States. The data is gathered by paid researchers, public records requests and crowdsourced data. We used Fatal Encounters to identify the number of police killings cases against Black American by states.
